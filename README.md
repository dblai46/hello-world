# hello-world
Someday, I want to be great at this craft. Today, is not that day. That doesn't mean I can't improve though. Maybe tomorrow will be great?

I'm here to learn. Sometimes I want to learn too much. I have dabbled in many programming languages but know none. My appetite for curiosity is somewhat insatiable but I am working on trying to do one thing at a time. Right now I am working on web development and trying to learn Java.
